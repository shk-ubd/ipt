# Workout App

Welcome to the Workout App! This project utilizes the MERN stack for building a full-stack web application.

## Getting Started

### Frontend (React App)

This project's frontend was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

#### Available Scripts

In the `frontend` directory, you can run:

- `npm start`: Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
- `npm test`: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

See the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started) for more information.

### Backend (Node.js)

The backend is set up using Node.js and npm. The server configurations and dependencies are in the `backend` directory.

#### .gitignore

Both the `frontend` and `backend` directories have a `.gitignore` file to exclude the `node_modules` folder. This is a good practice to avoid unnecessary files in your repository.
